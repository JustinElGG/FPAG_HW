TIMING-27#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock sys_clk_pin is created on an inappropriate internal pin design_1_i/RGB_LED_0/inst/clk. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins

XDCC-1#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint with the same name. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
