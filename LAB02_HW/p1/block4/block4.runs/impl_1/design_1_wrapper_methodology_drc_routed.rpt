2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-17#1 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/RGB_LED_0/inst/counter_256_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/RGB_LED_0/inst/counter_256_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/RGB_LED_0/inst/counter_256_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/RGB_LED_0/inst/counter_256_reg[3]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#5 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/RGB_LED_0/inst/counter_256_reg[4]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#6 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/RGB_LED_0/inst/counter_256_reg[5]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#7 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/RGB_LED_0/inst/counter_256_reg[6]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#8 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin design_1_i/RGB_LED_0/inst/counter_256_reg[7]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on rst relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock sys_clk_pin is created on an inappropriate internal pin design_1_i/divider_0/inst/clk. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

XDCC-1#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint with the same name. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 8.000 -name sys_clk_pin -waveform {0.000 4.000} -add [get_ports -scoped_to_current_instance clk] (Source: d:/FPGA/LAB02_HW/p1/block4/block4.srcs/FPGA/LAB02_HW/p1/block1/block1.srcs/constrs_1/new/de_OOC.xdc (Line: 1))
