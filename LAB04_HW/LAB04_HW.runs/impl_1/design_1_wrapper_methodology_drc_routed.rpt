2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.534 ns between design_1_i/arithemetic_0/inst/arithemetic_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/slv_reg0_reg[9]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and design_1_i/arithemetic_0/inst/arithemetic_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/axi_rdata_reg[2]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -4.329 ns between design_1_i/arithemetic_0/inst/arithemetic_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/slv_reg0_reg[9]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and design_1_i/arithemetic_0/inst/arithemetic_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/axi_rdata_reg[1]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -6.128 ns between design_1_i/arithemetic_0/inst/arithemetic_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/slv_reg0_reg[9]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and design_1_i/arithemetic_0/inst/arithemetic_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/axi_rdata_reg[0]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
